## 3. Platform API pricing (OnlyFans & Fansly)

Creatix relies on third-party platform APIs so creators can sync data and send messages. Your cost scales with **how many creator accounts** (OnlyFans/Fansly profiles) you connect, not just how many Creatix users you have.

### 3.A OnlyFans API ([onlyfansapi.com/pricing](https://onlyfansapi.com/pricing))

| Plan | Price | Accounts | Credits (monthly) | RPM |
|------|--------|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Free | $0 | 1 | 10 | 1,000 |
| Basic | $69/mo | 1 | 20,000 | 1,000 |
| **Pro** | **$299/mo** | **5 included** | **100,000 + 10k/account** | **5,000** |
| Enterprise | Quote | Custom | Custom | Custom |

- **Additional OnlyFans account (over 5):** **$10/account/month** (scale discounts on site: e.g. +20 accounts ~$26.1/account, +100 ~$20.3/account; we use **$10** as requested for this report).
- Pro scale discounts: +20 accounts 10% off, +50 20% off, … +500 60% off. For 100+ accounts consider [OnlyFans API scale discounts](https://onlyfansapi.com/pricing).

**Example OnlyFans API cost (using $10 per extra account):**

- 10 OF accounts → Pro $299 + 5×$10 = **$349/mo**
- 100 OF accounts → $299 + 95×$10 = **$1,249/mo**
- 1,000 OF accounts → $299 + 995×$10 = **$10,249/mo**
- 10,000 OF accounts → Enterprise (custom quote); or ballpark **~$100k+/mo** if linearly extended.

### 3.B Fansly API ([apifansly.com/pricing](https://apifansly.com/pricing))

| Plan | Price | Accounts | Credits (monthly) | RPM |
|------|--------|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Free | $0 | 1 | 30 | 100 |
| Starter | $49/mo | 2 | 24,000 | 600 |
| **Pro** | **$129/mo** | **5** | **60,000** | **1,000** |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | Custom | Unlimited |

- **Additional Fansly “users” (creator accounts):** treated here as **$10 per 1,000 users** (as specified). So: 1,000 Fansly accounts ≈ **$10/mo** extra; 10,000 accounts ≈ **$100/mo** extra.

**Example Fansly API cost (using $10 per 1,000 users):**

- 10 creators on Fansly → **~$0.10/mo** (negligible)
- 100 creators → **~$1/mo**
- 1,000 creators → **~$10/mo**
- 10,000 creators → **~$100/mo** (on top of base Pro or Enterprise)

*(If your contract is “per account” at different rates, replace the formula above with your actual Fansly pricing.)*

## 4. Pricing packages vs. feature access & costs

### 4.1 Plans we offer

**Trial** is still `divine-trial` in `lib/products.ts` (free trial, limited credits/storage).

**Paid** subscriptions use a single canonical plan id **`cev-paid`** in the database, with **revenue tier** (0–10) and **billing variant** (`single` | `multi`) stored on `subscriptions` (see `scripts/040_subscriptions_billing_tiers.sql`). Dollar amounts and bands live in **`lib/pricing-matrix.ts`** (11 rows × Single vs Multi prices). Legacy Stripe IDs `venus-pro`, `circe-elite`, and `divine-duo` are still recognized for access via `lib/billing/access.ts` until migrated.

- **Single**: OnlyFans only among adult platform integrations.
- **Multi**: OnlyFans plus at least one other adult platform (e.g. Fansly, ManyVids), or only non‑OF adult connected — see `lib/billing/platform-variant.ts`. Users on a **Single** paid plan are blocked from connecting a second adult platform until they move to **Multi** (see `components/platform/platform-connector.tsx`).

Storage and AI credit limits for paid tiers are unified to high caps via `lib/billing/plan-limits.ts` and Stripe upserts.

### 4.2 Feature access by plan

At the code level, **Pro** is gated with **`isPaidPlanId()`** from `lib/billing/access.ts` (includes `cev-paid` and legacy IDs). Practically:

- **Trial** (`divine-trial`): limited AI credits and storage; core features with caps.
- **Paid** (`cev-paid` or legacy Pro IDs): full Pro tool access within fair‑use limits; tier/variant mainly affects **price** and **which adult platforms** may be connected under Single vs Multi.

### 4.3 Cost comparison: what each plan actually costs you to run

Below is an **approximate “cost to run” vs. price** comparison, using the infrastructure and AI estimates from this report. **Customer prices** are now the **revenue-band matrix** (`lib/pricing-matrix.ts`), not fixed $49/$99/$199 SKUs — treat the following **Venus / Elite / Duo** subsections as **illustrative** variable‑cost examples at a given monthly list price, not current product names.

Assumptions:

- Supabase Pro: ~$25/mo (if you’re in production).
- Vercel Pro: ~$20/mo.
- AI low/medium/high usage per report (Section 4).
- Stripe fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per successful charge (ignored in “infrastructure” cost here).

#### Divine Trial (`divine-trial`, $0 for user)

- **Your infra cost**:
  - Database + hosting shared across all users (roughly fixed).
  - AI: capped by **100 AI credits**, so per‑user AI cost is a few cents to **<$1** during the trial.
- **You charge**: $0.
- **Net**: Customer acquisition cost; trial is intentionally a cost center to convert to Pro. Per‑trial infra cost is low because of strict caps.

#### Venus Pro (`venus-pro`, $49/mo)

- **Your typical infra cost per active Pro user** (medium usage):
  - AI: **$5–$15/mo** (mix of GPT‑4o‑mini + occasional Claude/Grok).
  - Marginal DB + hosting: **$1–$3/mo** incremental per user at moderate scale.
  - Total rough **per‑user variable cost**: **$6–$18/mo**.
- **You charge**: **$49/mo**.
- **Gross margin on infra**: roughly **$31–$43/mo per active Pro user**, before support and overhead.

#### Circe Elite (`circe-elite`, $99/mo)

- **Your typical infra cost per Elite user**:
  - AI: **$10–$30/mo** (more heavy usage of protection tools, Pro models, Divine Manager automation).
  - Incremental DB/hosting: **$2–$5/mo** (more analytics, leaks, DMCA, storage).
  - Total variable: roughly **$12–$35/mo**.
- **You charge**: **$99/mo**.
- **Gross margin on infra**: roughly **$64–$87/mo per Elite user**.

#### Divine Duo (`divine-duo`, $199/mo)

- **Your typical infra cost per Duo user (or account in a small team)**:
  - AI: **$20–$60+/mo** (multi‑account, more automation, more Pro tools).
  - Incremental DB/hosting: **$5–$10/mo** (more content, fans, analytics, DMs).
  - Total variable: roughly **$25–$70+/mo**.
- **You charge**: **$199/mo**.
- **Gross margin on infra**: roughly **$129–$174+/mo per Duo customer**, leaving room for human services (onboarding, support, legal access, custom work).

### 4.4 “How much does it cost me compared to running this myself?”

If you tried to reproduce Creatix yourself with similar quality:

- **AI** (per creator): you’d pay the same raw OpenAI/Anthropic/XAI prices, but without shared prompt engineering, batching, or credits system. Expect **$20–$100+/mo** if you used it at the same intensity.
- **Database + hosting**: Supabase Pro (~$25/mo) + Vercel Pro (~$20/mo) just to host a single‑tenant clone, plus your engineering time.
- **Stripe & integrations**: Same % fees; you’d also pay with developer time to keep webhooks and platform APIs stable.
- **Engineering & maintenance**: Ongoing development, ops, and compliance costs far exceed raw infra.

So, compared to your own raw infra bill for equivalent AI usage and hosting (**$60–$150+/mo** + engineering), each plan effectively **bundles and amortizes**:

- Shared infra (Supabase, Vercel, AI gateways).
- Prompt tuning and orchestration (Divine Manager, Circe/Venus).
- Integrations and updates.

Roughly:

- **Venus Pro ($49/mo)**: priced **around or below what it would cost you just to run equivalent AI usage + basic infra**, before any engineering.
- **Circe Elite ($99/mo)** and **Divine Duo ($199/mo)**: priced to cover heavier AI usage and protection/agency workflows while still being **meaningfully cheaper** than building and operating your own stack with similar functionality.

### 4.5 Cost and profit at scale (10 / 100 / 1,000 / 10,000 users)

This section estimates **your total cost** (platform APIs, AI, database, hosting, Stripe) and **revenue** at different user counts, so you can see **profit** for each scale. Assumptions:

- **OnlyFans API:** [Pro $299/mo for 5 accounts](https://onlyfansapi.com/pricing); **each additional OF account = $10/mo** (as specified).
- **Fansly API:** [Pro $129/mo or similar](https://apifansly.com/pricing); **$10 per 1,000 creator accounts** (as specified).
- **User mix (paying only):** 50% Venus Pro ($49), 30% Circe Elite ($99), 20% Divine Duo ($199). **ARPU ≈ $94/mo.**
- **Conversion:** At each scale we assume 70% of “users” are paying (30% trial/churn). So: 10 users → 7 paying, 100 → 70, 1,000 → 700, 10,000 → 7,000 paying.
- **OF/Fansly accounts:** We assume **1 OnlyFans account per paying user** on average, and **0.5 Fansly accounts per paying user** (half also use Fansly). So 7 paying → 7 OF + 3.5 Fansly; 70 → 70 OF + 35 Fansly; 700 → 700 OF + 350 Fansly; 7,000 → 7,000 OF + 3,500 Fansly.
- **AI:** Scales with paying users; low/medium/high bands from Section 6.
- **Stripe:** 2.9% + $0.30 per successful charge (on subscription revenue).
- **Supabase:** $25/mo up to 1k users; $50–$100 at 10k.
- **Vercel:** $20/mo up to 1k users; $100–$300 at 10k.

**Revenue (monthly, rounded):**

| Users (total) | Paying (70%) | Revenue (@ $94 ARPU) |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 10            | 7             | **~$660**              |
| 100           | 70            | **~$6,600**            |
| 1,000         | 700           | **~$66,000**           |
| 10,000        | 7,000         | **~$660,000**          |

**Your costs (monthly, rounded):**

| Cost line            | 10 users   | 100 users   | 1,000 users  | 10,000 users   |
|----------------------|------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| OnlyFans API         | $349       | $1,249      | $10,249      | Enterprise     |
| Fansly API           | ~$0        | ~$1         | ~$10         | ~$100          |
| AI (OpenAI/Claude/XAI) | $40      | $200        | $2,000       | $18,000        |
| Supabase             | $25        | $25         | $25          | $75            |
| Vercel               | $20        | $20         | $20          | $200           |
| Stripe (2.9% + $0.30) | ~$20       | ~$200       | ~$2,000      | ~$20,000       |
| **Total cost**       | **~$454**  | **~$1,695** | **~$14,304** | **~$38,375**   |

*OnlyFans at 10k: Enterprise quote; total cost uses a placeholder ~$38k; adjust with real quote.*

**Profit (revenue − total cost):**

| Users (total) | Revenue  | Total cost | **Profit (approx.)** |
|---------------|----------|------------|------------------------|
| 10            | ~$660    | ~$454      | **~$206/mo**          |
| 100           | ~$6,600  | ~$1,695    | **~$4,905/mo**        |
| 1,000         | ~$66,000 | ~$14,304   | **~$51,696/mo**       |
| 10,000        | ~$660,000| ~$38,375   | **~$621,625/mo**      |

Summary:

- **10 users:** OnlyFans API (Pro + 5 extra accounts) dominates cost; you still net **~$200/mo**.
- **100 users:** Profit **~$5k/mo**; OF API and AI are the main cost lines.
- **1,000 users:** Profit **~$52k/mo**; OF API at **~$10k** is the largest single cost; AI and Stripe scale with revenue.
- **10,000 users:** OnlyFans moves to Enterprise (custom pricing); profit is sensitive to that quote. If OF + infra stay in a similar proportion, **profit can exceed $600k/mo** at these assumptions.

To refine: (1) plug in your real OnlyFans API scale discounts or Enterprise quote, (2) adjust Fansly pricing if your contract differs from “$10 per 1,000 users”, (3) measure actual AI and Stripe usage per user.

## 5. Database (Supabase)

### 5.1 Tables (from migrations)

- **Auth:** `auth.users` (Supabase managed)
- **Core:** `profiles`, `platform_connections`, `fans`, `fan_tags`, `fan_tag_assignments`, `content`, `conversations`, `messages`, `message_templates`
- **Analytics & growth:** `analytics_snapshots`
- **Protection:** `leak_alerts`, `reputation_mentions`, `dmca_claims` (and related)
- **Product:** `subscriptions` (Stripe-linked; `plan_id`, `ai_credits_used`, `ai_credits_limit`, etc.), `notification_preferences`, `notifications`, `user_api_keys`
- **Divine Manager:** `divine_manager_settings`, `divine_manager_tasks`
- **Social:** `social_profiles`, `oauth_states`
- **Schema details:** Enums and RLS on manager tables; multiple migrations (001–018, plus one-off scripts)

### 5.2 Estimated database cost (Supabase)

- **Free tier:** 500 MB DB, 1 GB file storage, 2 GB bandwidth – suitable for early development and light usage.
- **Pro (~$25/month):** 8 GB DB, 100 GB storage, 250 GB bandwidth – recommended for production with multiple creators and sync.
- **Usage drivers:** Row growth in `fans`, `messages`, `content`, `analytics_snapshots`, `divine_manager_tasks`; auth and RLS are standard.

*Estimate: assume Pro for production; **~\$25/month** for database (Supabase Pro).*

---

## 6. AI cost estimates

### 6.1 Assumptions

- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini:** ~$0.15/1M input, ~$0.60/1M output (approximate list pricing).
- **Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4:** order of ~$3/1M input, ~$15/1M output (check current pricing).
- **XAI Grok:** usage-based; typically in a similar range to other premium models.
- **Volume:** “per 1M tokens” and “per request” are ballpark; real cost depends on traffic and prompt sizes.

### 6.2 By usage type

| Usage type | Model | Est. tokens/request (in+out) | Est. cost/1k requests |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Circe/Venus/Flirt/Chat (streaming) | GPT-4o-mini | ~2–4k | ~\$0.50–\$1.50 |
| Message suggestions (scan/circe/venus/flirt) | GPT-4o-mini or Grok | ~1–2k | ~\$0.25–\$0.75 (OpenAI) |
| Divine Manager (brain, voice, chat) | GPT-4o-mini | ~1.5–3k | ~\$0.40–\$1.20 |
| Tool-run + content/caption/mood/etc. | GPT-4o-mini | ~1–3k | ~\$0.25–\$1.00 |
| Churn / Pricing / Mass DM / Voice clone | Claude Sonnet 4 | ~2–5k | ~\$5–\$15 |
| Pro tools (Oracle, Venus, etc.) with Grok | XAI Grok | ~2–4k | Depends on XAI pricing |

### 6.3 Monthly AI cost (ballpark)

- **Low traffic:** 10–20k AI requests/month, mostly GPT-4o-mini → **~\$15–\$40/month** (OpenAI dominant).
- **Medium traffic:** 50–100k requests, mix of OpenAI + some Claude + optional Grok → **~\$80–\$200/month**.
- **High traffic:** 200k+ requests, Pro users using Claude and Grok → **~\$300–\$800+/month**.

*Actuals depend on prompt lengths, streaming vs non-streaming, and which tools are used.*

## 7. External API costs

| Service | Role | Typical cost model |
|---------|------|--------------------|
| **OnlyFans** | OAuth, sync, messages, webhooks | Usually no per-call fee to you; partnership/ToS apply. |
| **Fansly** | Auth, sync, webhooks, conversations | Similar; check partnership/API terms. |
| **Stripe** | Subscriptions, one-time payments, webhooks | **~2.9% + \$0.30 per successful charge**; no monthly fee for standard usage. |
| **OpenAI** | See AI section | Per-token (above). |
| **Anthropic** | Claude | Per-token (above). |
| **XAI** | Grok (optional) | Per-token / per-request; check x.ai pricing. |
| **Vercel** | Hosting, serverless, cron | See Hosting. |

*OnlyFans/Fansly are not itemized as a direct “API cost” in dollars; Stripe is the main external API cost besides AI.*

## 8. Hosting (Vercel)

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router), serverless functions for API routes.
- **Analytics:** `@vercel/analytics` in use.
- **Cron:** Divine Manager cron uses Vercel Cron or external trigger (CRON_SECRET / `x-vercel-cron`).
- **Domain:** App URL referenced as `https://circe-venus.vercel.app`.

### 8.1 Estimated hosting cost (Vercel)

- **Hobby:** Free for personal; limited serverless execution and bandwidth.
- **Pro (~\$20/user/month):** Better limits, cron, team features – **~\$20/month** for a single Pro seat.
- **Usage:** Depends on serverless invocations (API routes, auth, webhooks) and bandwidth; Pro is typical for production.

*Estimate: **~\$20/month** (Vercel Pro) for production.*

## 9. Combined monthly cost summary (estimates)

| Category | Low (early stage) | Medium (growing) | High (scale) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Database (Supabase)** | \$0 (free) | \$25 (Pro) | \$25–\$50+ |
| **Hosting (Vercel)** | \$0 (Hobby) | \$20 (Pro) | \$20–\$100+ |
| **AI (OpenAI + Claude + optional XAI)** | \$15–\$40 | \$80–\$200 | \$300–\$800+ |
| **Stripe** | % of revenue | % of revenue | % of revenue |
| **APIs (OnlyFans/Fansly)** | \$0 direct | \$0 direct | \$0 direct |
| **Total (ex. Stripe)** | **~\$15–\$40** | **~\$125–\$245** | **~\$345–\$950+** |

*Stripe is not a fixed monthly cost; it scales with revenue (e.g. 2.9% + \$0.30 per charge).*
